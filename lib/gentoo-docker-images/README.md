# Gentoo Docker Images

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gentoo/gentoo-docker-images.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gentoo/gentoo-docker-images)

A collection of Dockerfiles for generating Gentoo docker images.

These images are intended to be created automatically by
a travis cron job and pushed to [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/gentoo/).
This repository include basic stage3 images and an image usable as a `/usr/portage` volume

# Building the containers

The containers are created using a multi-stage build, which requires docker-17.05.0 or later.
The container being built is defined by the TARGET environment variable:

`` TARGET=stage3-amd64 ./build.sh ``

# Using the portage container as a data volume

```
docker create -v /usr/portage --name myportagesnapshot gentoo/portage:latest /bin/true
docker run --volumes-from myportagesnapshot gentoo/stage3-amd64:latest /bin/bash
```

  pull requests
* Make meaningful commits ideally with the following form:

  * Body–why this commit is necessary or desired
* Pull requests should not include merge commits
* Use amend and rebase to fix commits after a pull request has been submitted
